# The Underthreaded Blog List

Welcome to our curated list of tech blog/content feeds.
We tend to choose blogs which meet our own subjective (and perhaps flawed) views on quality blogs.
If a blog does not appear on this list, it doesn't mean we don't rate it.
Raise an issue or PR to add it, and we'll gladly review and add if we decide we want it included.

Feel free to use the opml file in the repo, or peruse the README to find new people to follow!
